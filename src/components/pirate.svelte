Gather 'round, ye salty dogs,
And lend an ear to me.
A tale of buccaneers so bold,
Who conquered land and sea.

The Jolly Roger flyin' high,
Upon our mighty mast.
We've bested beasts in lands afar,
Our courage unsurpassed.

The Kraken rose from depths unknown,
Its eyes with evil glow.
Our cannons roared and flashed until
The beast lay dead below.

We patched our ship with sturdy oak,
And stowed a treasure rare:
A cache of beads from distant shores,
A value beyond compare.

With southern winds to fill our sails,
We charted course for home.
Eager to share our journey's tale,
That tested heart and bone.

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's tale,
With victory amassed.
We've bested beasts in lands afar,
Our courage unsurpassed.
