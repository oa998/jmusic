In a sterile room
I'm stuck like glue
Counting the days
I want something to chew
I'm happy but bored
And my spirit is strong
Dreaming 'bout food
Yeah
All day long

My diet is strange
It's a twisted game
Mostly doughnuts and morphine
That's my claim
I'm craving more sprinkles
and I can't get enough
Oh, Sugary sweetness.
That's my hospital stuff

Doughnuts are my sweet salvation
They're my happy pills
My joyful sensation
Though I can't go number two
I'm feeling just fine
I'm gonna bounce back
One doughnut at a time
