<pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap py-10 text-[8pt] px-2">
On a cloudless night
I'm on a quest
With my telescope
I won't settle for less
Lookin’ for a planet
Elusive and bright.
Searching for Uranus
Gonna find you tonight

It ain’t a star and
It ain’t my derriere.
Lost in the night sky
But I'll find you I swear
Spinnin' in the darkness
Elusive as can be
Oh Uranus
Won't you come play with me? 

I’m in a cosmic game
Of hide and seek
Trying to find Uranus
And the secrets that it keeps
But I won't give up (No)
I won't back down
I'll keep on searchin'
'til you're finally found
  </pre>
