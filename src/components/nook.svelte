There's a kitty cat named Nook
got a tail so divine
Curly as can be
it's a sight so fine
He struts down the street
with a swag and a purr
Catching all the eyes
he's the king of the feline blur

Oh, Nook, Nook
with your tail so curly
You bring joy and laughter to this world, surely
Oh, Nook, Nook
what a delightful sight
Everyone can't help but smile
when you're in the spotlight

He's got style
he's got grace
he's got finesse
With his playful antics
he's the coolest, I confess
He's got a swagger in his step
 and a twinkle in his eye
Nook's the talk of the town
 no one can deny
